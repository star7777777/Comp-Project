Project Proposal:

  Lung cancer is the leading cause of cancer-related deaths in the world.
Regardless of improvement in diagnosis, treatment, and health care of lung cancer,
there is still a high death rate with a low survival probability if detected during late
stages. In most cases, patients are diagnosed with lung cancer at an advanced stage
when the disease has already spread to other parts of the body. Moreover, studies
showed early detection and early treatment lung cancer offers a favorable prognosis.
Thus, there is a need to find the groups of people with the highest probability of getting
lung cancer and diagnose them early to decrease the mortality rate of cancer.

  For this project, data will be taken from the SEER Cancer Incidence page in
tabular form (cancer data provided by the US government ) and uploaded to Github. 1
Throughout this project, we will use Github and RStudio (which uses the statistical
language R). The data tables will use data from within the last 30 years and the data
sets used are the probability of developing lung cancer, the probability of dying from
lung cancer, the mortality rate of lung cancer, and the survival time of cancer.

  After the program is completed, it would be able to provide statistical analysis
and graphs of the data. These graphs would include, but are not limited to: Histograms,
scatter plots, density plots, and boxplots. In addition, the finished program would be
able to output customized data according to the imputed queries. Through the use of
this program, there would be an increased observation of the groups with higher risk
factors.
